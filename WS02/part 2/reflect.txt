 This week we mainly foccused on copy and move semantics, using command line argument for inputting text file, and understanding what is lvalue and rvalue. 

 First for inputting text file via command line argument, I found the key to understanding file input is to think of feeding a set of string into the buffer until the delimiter or end of file. Therefore, I used getline(), which serves this purpose well, and easier for me to understand. Once I have the total number of the string, I rewinded the file ptr to the beginning of the file, and since rewind is only in C, I used file.seekg(0, ios::beg) which is the c++ equivalent of rewind(). This function will seek and get the pointer to the beginning positon of 0.

 There's a newly introduced library chrono we used in this assignment, we used the system_clock at ws1,
